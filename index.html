	<h1> Richard Gary Biography </h1>
		<p><strong>First off, Richard prefers to go by <acronym title="Richard Jerome">RJ.</acronym></strong></p>
		
		<p>Now that you know that, RJ is (at the time this page is being made, who knows if he’ll update it) a freshman at the University of Georgia.
		As of now, he plans to co-major in International Business and Finance.
		Here’s the crazy part: he’s also doing three minors — French, Violin Performance, and Statistics. 
		He loves playing his violin and singing, as well as pretending he’s good at piano.</p>
		
		<p>When he’s not busy playing or listening to music, RJ loves spending time on his computer.
		This means anything from watching Netflix and YouTube to reading the news to shopping for things he can’t afford on Amazon.
		Oh, and sometimes he uses the computer to do homework and study, too.</p>
		
		<p>Aside from technology, RJ loves being outside.
		This means anything that will keep him out of the dorm room.
		He enjoys walking around campus, going for long rides on the bus, and exploring new campus buildings he probably isn’t supposed to be in.
		He has run many triathlons, and plans to join UGA’s club triathlon team in the spring!</p>
		
		<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
